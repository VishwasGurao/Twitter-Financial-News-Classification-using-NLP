    "## 📂 Dataset Overview\n",
    "- Twitter posts related to financial markets and events\n",
    "- Multi-class classification problem\n",
    "- Real-world class imbalance across categories\n",
    "- Short and noisy text typical of social media platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "Key insights from EDA:\n",
    "- Strong class imbalance across financial categories\n",
    "- Significant variation in tweet length by category\n",
    "- Majority classes dominate overall distribution\n",
    "- Minority classes contain limited but meaningful information\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Deep Learning Exploration (BERT)\n",
    "A BERT-based model was initiated to explore deep learning approaches.\n",
    "However, due to CPU-only hardware constraints and long training time,\n",
    "the model was intentionally stopped.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reflects a practical engineering trade-off between model complexity,\n",
    "computational resources, and project timelines.\n",
