    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project was to build an end-to-end Natural Language\n",
    "Processing (NLP) pipeline to classify Twitter financial news into multiple\n",
    "financial categories. The project emphasizes practical model selection,\n",
    "efficient feature engineering, and fair comparison of classical machine\n",
    "learning models under real-world resource constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of Twitter posts related to financial news, each labeled\n",
    "into predefined financial categories such as company updates, macroeconomic\n",
    "events, market movements, and corporate actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of the dataset include:\n",
    "- Multi-class classification problem\n",
    "- Noticeable class imbalance across categories\n",
    "- Short-form, noisy text typical of social media data\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory analysis revealed the following insights:\n",
    "- A small number of categories dominate the dataset\n",
    "- Minority classes contain limited but information-dense samples\n",
    "- Tweet length varies significantly by news category\n",
    "- Class imbalance is a critical challenge affecting model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA guided feature engineering decisions and evaluation strategy selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 4. Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "The following feature engineering techniques were applied:\n",
    "- Text cleaning and normalization\n",
    "- Removal of low-information samples\n",
    "- TF-IDF vectorization using unigrams and bigrams\n",
    "- Feature dimensionality control for computational efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensured consistency and fairness across all model comparisons.\n",

    "## 7. Deep Learning Exploration (BERT)\n",
    "\n",
    "A BERT-based model was initiated to explore deep learning approaches for text\n",
    "classification. However, due to CPU-only hardware constraints and significantly\n",
    "long training times, the model was not fully trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision to prioritize efficient classical models reflects real-world\n",
    "engineering trade-offs between model complexity, resource availability, and\n",
    "project timelines.\n",
